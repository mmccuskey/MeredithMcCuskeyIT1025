# Executive Summary
Explain the goal for this lab

# LucidChart
* See DecisionFlowchart.jpeg

My experience using Lucidchart was extremely simple. The tutorial was easy to understand and showed me how to create a basic chart as well as how to export my flowchart. I found Lucidchart to be user friendly and easy to navigate. It only took me a couple minutes to create a flowchart for this lab.

# Intro to Networking
## Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions

* Packet - Unit of data
* Packet-Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
* IP Address - Unique identifying number 
* DNS - Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)
* Protocol - Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

## Network Hardware
* The benefit of a switch over a hub is that it is able to store mac addresses and send packets to specific addresses instead of to every device connected like a hub would do. A switch will send data only to the intended port instead of to all of them. A hub can only detect that a device is connected to it, while a switch can detect specific devices that are connected to it because of its ability to keep a record of the mac addresses. This reduces bandwidth and increases privacy and security. 
* The benefit of a router over a hub and switch is that a router can read IP addresses. This allows data to be transferred from one network to another based on their IP address. A hub or switch can't read IP addresses and is only used for sending data within the same network. 

## Network Topology
* Single point of failure refers to a part of a system that will affect the entire system from working if it fails or breaks down. Star, bus, and ring are some of the topologies that experience this issue.
* Infrastructure topology uses a combination of wired and wireless devices. It is similar to a star topology where there are computers physically connected to a switch but you also have a wireless access point connected by a cable to the switch. Wireless devices such as laptops and smartphones can connect wirelessly to the network. Infrastructure topologies can have multiple wireless entry points. Wireless mesh topoloies are similar to mesh topologies where devices are interconnected with each other except wirelessly. In this type of a setup, each type of wireless access point will talk to other wireless access points so that wireless devices could connect even if they are physically far away from the modem. I think a wireless mesh topology is better because there is less cables, therefore it is cheaper and easier to set up. It will be able to continue working even if one of the wireless access points is broken because it will reroute the data through the other access points.

# Cybersecurity and Encryption
* If I was a part of the Amazon.com online chat, this is how each component of the security triad would impact my job. For confidentiality, it would be important to make sure that potential customers financial information is kept safe and is unaccessable by the public. In terms of integrity, making sure that the information given over the chat is honest and accurate and from someone who works from the company is necessary. For availability, it would be good practice to have a list of resources for FAQ to direct customers to information they need if they have trouble finding it. 

* Three daily tasks that require authentication are logging into your bank account, entering an apartment building, and logging onto social media. Logging into your bank account requires you to put your username and password. If your bank required you to put your fingerprint in as well as enter your username and password, then it would become multi-factor authentication because you are combining something you know and something you are. For my apartment building, we can't enter unless we have a key that gets scanned by a system at the front door. For my apartment building to have multi-factor identification, they would have to add something like a PIN that we have to input to get in because then I would have to have something I know and something I have in order to gain access. Logging onto social media would be converted to multi-factor authentication if you had to enter your username and password along with a code texted to your phone.

* The Access Control List (ACL) is a list of users who have the ability to perform certain actions. Each user has specific capabilities such as reading or writing. An advangtage of the ACL is it's easy to understand and maintain. Role Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns users roles and then assigns the roles access. This type of a system works better with a large amount of users as it simplifies administration and improves security.

* Ciphertext is plain text that has been encoded so that only authorized parties can access it. When you want to encode and decode data, you need a public key and a private key. The private key is used to decrypt ciphertext sent with the public key. 

* We need public key cryptography in order to securely send data to other people without worrying about a third party intercepting private information. Public key cryptography is used in many daily activities we participate in such as banking and online shopping. Public key cryptography ensures the confidentiality of our data.

## Cryptography
* Type a message in the "Caesar Cipher Exploration box and turn the wheel to encrypt your message. Then explain the encryption here:

* Type a message in the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" box and a) Explain the result. b) Would it be different for different languages?

* What is a "Polyalphabetic cipher?" Type a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word. Explain the result.

## Brute Force
* What is Brute-Force and how does it relate to Kerckhoffs's principle?
