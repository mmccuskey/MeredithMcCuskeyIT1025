# Executive Summary
Explain the goal for this lab

# LucidChart
* See DecisionFlowchart.jpeg

My experience using Lucidchart was extremely simple. The tutorial was easy to understand and showed me how to create a basic chart as well as how to export my flowchart. I found Lucidchart to be user friendly and easy to navigate. It only took me a couple minutes to create a flowchart for this lab.

# Intro to Networking
## Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions

* Packet - Unit of data
* Packet-Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
* IP Address - Unique identifying number 
* DNS - Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)
* Protocol - Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

## Network Hardware
* The benefit of a switch over a hub is that it is able to store mac addresses and send packets to specific addresses instead of to every device connected like a hub would do. A switch will send data only to the intended port instead of to all of them. A hub can only detect that a device is connected to it, while a switch can detect specific devices that are connected to it because of its ability to keep a record of the mac addresses. This reduces bandwidth and increases privacy and security. 
* The benefit of a router over a hub and switch is that a router can read IP addresses. This allows data to be transferred from one network to another based on their IP address. A hub or switch can't read IP addresses and is only used for sending data within the same network. 

## Network Topology
* Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue.
* Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?

# Cybersecurity and Encryption
* Imagine you are part of the Amazon.com online chat. Explain how each component of the security triad would impact your job
* Identify three daily tasks that require authentication. Explain how each one could be converted to multi-factor authentication
* Explain ACL and RBAC. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
* Explain the interaction of ciphertext, a public key and a private key
* Explain why we need public key cryptography.

## Cryptography
* Type a message in the "Caesar Cipher Exploration box and turn the wheel to encrypt your message. Then explain the encryption here:

* Type a message in the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" box and a) Explain the result. b) Would it be different for different languages?

* What is a "Polyalphabetic cipher?" Type a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word. Explain the result.

## Brute Force
* What is Brute-Force and how does it relate to Kerckhoffs's principle?
