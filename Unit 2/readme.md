## Hard Drives and Memory
* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?
Latency is the amount of time it takes a hard drive to rotate the desired sector into position under the read-write head. It is calculated to be half a rotation. Disks that rotate faster deliver higher mechanical latency. There are two types of trasfer rates: the disk transfer rate and the data transfer rate. The disk transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media. The data transfer rate is the speed at which the host computer can transfer data across the IDE/EIDE or SCSI interface to the CPU.

* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?
A solid state drive (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive because it lacks a physical read head which means data can be stored anywhere without penalty. SSDs are therefore, much faster than a traditional hard drive. In a SSD there are no moving parts. Data is split up into word length pieces and stored in memory. The information can be accessed immediately; there is no latencies issues while transferring data.

* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?
Increasing RAM makes the computer run faster because more data can be loaded into the faster RAM without the need of accessing the slower hard drive. The data is then transferred directly to the CPU. 

* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?
64 and 32 bit are used to describe processor architecture. A 32 bit processor contains a 32 bit register and can store 2^32 values while a 64 bit processor contains a 64 bit register and can store 2^64 values. The CPU register stores memory addresses which is how the processor accesses data from RAM. 32 bit programs can run on a 64 bit system but 64 bit programs will not run on a 32 bit system.


## ALU and Control Unit
* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU
The arithmitic logic unit (ALU) is under the command of the control unit within the CPU. The control unit recieves an instruction from RAM and then tells the ALU what type of operation it should perform. The ALU performs all the mathematical operations.

## CPU, Input and Output
* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output
The CPU interacts with Input and Output devices. Input devices would be keyboards, scanners, microphones, and digital cameras. The CPU recieves data that the input device converts to binary. The binary code tells the CPU what to display and then the CPU communicates with memory to store the results. The results are sent in binary code to the output device such as the screen, printer, or speaker.

## Logic Gates and circuits
* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.
A truth table is a table that contains the inputs and outputs for a specific type of gate. The inputs and outputs are represented using boolean logic which means in 1s and 0s, or true and false. A NAND (a negated AND gate) is a digital logic gate with two or more inputs and one output. The output is true if one or more inputs are false. If both inputs are true, then the output is false.

* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate?
The behavior of a NAND gate is the opposite of the behavior of an AND gate. The truth gates are opposite in comparison. The output of an AND gate is only true if all of the inputs are true. If one or more of the inputs are false then the output is false.

## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
* Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design

# Data Representation

## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers
* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file) and save to a file named DecimalConversion and upload to your lab folder.

## Hexadecimal color representation
* Convert the binary representation: 10110101 to decimal and save your work to a file named BinaryConversion and upload to the lab folder.
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/
* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered.
