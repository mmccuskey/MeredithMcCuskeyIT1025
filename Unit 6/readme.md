## Internet Protocol
* What is an IP address and what is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
An IP address is a unique number assigned to a computer or device that is connected to the internet. IPv4 was the original internet protocol. It is a pool of unallocated addresses. IPv6 is the new internet protocol which has a bigger address space since all of the IPv4 unallocated addresses have been allocated to Internet Service Providers and users. IPv4 addresses are written as a string of four numbers between 0 and 255 seperated by dots. IPv6 addresses are much longer and are usually written using hexadecimals. Colons seperate segments of an IPv6 address instead of dots.

* The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is coordinates the unique identifying numbers of computers and devices across the world. It is a non-profit dedicated to keeping the internet secure, connected, and operable. It develops policies on the internet protocols such as IPv4 and IPv6. 

## TCP/IP
* TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol. TCP/IP is responsible for defining the details of how data is sent and recieved through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers and other network communications hardware. IP addresses communicate over ports. A port number is a way to identify specific connections between one computer or device and another. TCP/IP protocol creates a virtual IP port that the network hardware and software use to route data in and out of each virtual port.

* TCP/IP utilizes the client-server model. The client would be a computer or device that connects to the server. The client needs to know the IP address of the server as well as the port number. The server then has to accept or reject the connection. Once a connection is made data can be sent back and forth between these two devices through a port. The connection between the client and the server remains open until either the client or server terminates the connection. 

* Layers are important to incorporate into technology because it allows changes to be made to a system relatively easily. Each layer performs a specific function. If someone wanted to go in and change an aspect of that function, being able to identify a single layer and just focus on changing that one or replacing it without affecting the other layers is extremely important.

* Some of the types of applications that run on the application layer of TCP/IP is HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) as well as some email protocols like SMTP and POP3.
