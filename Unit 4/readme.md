# Executive Summary
Update this section for this lab explaining the purpose of the lab

# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
* A raster image is an image that is made up of thousands or sometimes millions of tiny pixels. Raster images look good when they are at their original size or smaller. If you try to enlarge a raster image you would see the pixels within the image. A vector image is rendered using a special form of geometry and they don't lose their quality no matter how small or large you make them.
* A raster image can be used for sending vacation pictures to a friend or for the background of a website. A vector image is more appropriately used in professional settings and a good use for them is when using an image to 2-D or 3-D print.

## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
* Why does it matter to developers whether they use lossless or lossy image formats?

## File Formats
* Explain the similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files.

# Operating Systems
Upload screenshots for Operating System tasks to github

## Logo
* Upload your logo image that you created from the Graphics Tasks
* Explain your image design including how many "layers" were required
* Right-click on your svg image file, select "properties" and report the file size and what application it "opens with." What application might be more appropriate and why (click the "change" button for options)
