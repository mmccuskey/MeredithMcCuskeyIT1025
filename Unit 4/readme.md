# Executive Summary
The purpose of Unit 4 Lab 4 was to introduce us the basics of an operating system. It goes over how to use the terminal to create directories and how to access them from there. It goes over image file formats including jpg, gif, and png. Compression methods such as lossless and lossy as well as types of graphics are also touched on. It requires you to create a vector image and upload it along with some terminal activities.

# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
* A raster image is an image that is made up of thousands or sometimes millions of tiny pixels. Raster images look good when they are at their original size or smaller. If you try to enlarge a raster image you would see the pixels within the image. A vector image is rendered using a special form of geometry and they don't lose their quality no matter how small or large you make them.
* A raster image can be used for sending vacation pictures to a friend or for the background of a website. A vector image is more appropriately used in professional settings and a good use for them is when using an image to 2-D or 3-D print.

## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
* The decision to use lossless or lossy image formats is an important one developers have to make. Lossless compression is seen as superior by many because all of the data from the original file is preserved. Although, if a developer is worried about the file size being too big, they would probably choose a lossy compression method.

## File Formats
* Explain the similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files.
Files that end in jpg, gif, and png are all used to identify and compress images. GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and is mainly used for animated images which neither of the file formats allow. JPEG is an image format that uses lossy compression to decrease the file size. PNG uses lossless compression and supports transparency options. Both gif and png use a bitmap image format.

## Logo
* See attached image - SVGGraphic.svg
* My image design was a heart shaped pizza with pepperoni on it with a banner in front of it that says "Mere's Pizza". There were 33 layers because of how many pepperoni pieces are on the pizza.
* The file size of this image is 94KB. The application it opens with is by default the Atom editor. I think the more appropriate option would be to open with google chrome because you can see the image instead of the code behind it.

# Conclusion
Unit 4 Lab 4 taught me about how to navigate the terminal which I was not familiar with before. I had trouble trying to find the commands for mac because they are a bit different than a windows operating system. After some quick Google searches I found the equivalent commands for the terminal in mac. I also did not know about the differences between file formats used with images and wasn't aware of the compression methods associated with them. I had fun making the pizza logo and am excited to learn more.
