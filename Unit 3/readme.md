# Executive Summary
Write up as though you are explaining this week's lab to others.

# Software
* Software is a broad category that includes many different types of systems. Application software, commonly referred to as apps, are programs designed for end-users. The Microsoft Office package that comes with a Word, PowerPoint, and Excel would be considered application software. Web browsers including Safari and Chrome are also considered application software. Utility software is used to support the computer infrastructure. Unlike application software which is aimed at directly permorming tasks to benefit the user, utility software helps fix and modify your computer. An example of a utility software would be an anti-malware software. Operating systems manage memory and processes as well as its application/utility software and hardware. Modern operating systems use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows you to see a combination of graphics and text on the screen. Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux are the most commonly used operating systems.

* Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software is used to bring an entire organization together with one program. Utilizing a central database, ERP software allows companies to integrate all facets of their operation and provides accessibility to a large number of employees. SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft all offer an ERP system.

* Virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual machine (VM) that simulates a computer with an operating system. A single computer can perform the functions of multiple virtual computers. VMs reduce the need for power, space, and cooling in a datacenter. Cloud computing is different than virtualization. Cloud computing is when applications, services and data storage are accessible from the Internet. Cloud computing shares computing resources and is You don't have to install or upgrade any software with cloud computing like you do for virtualization. Virtualization is a technology vs cloud is an enviornment. Virtualization can be used to create clouds.

# Virtualization
* Virtualization helps companies cut down on IT costs while boosting efficiency and agility. It simplifies data management and allows for easier disaster recovery. IT organizations are able to run multiple applications and operating systems on just 1 server. This reduces the costs associated with setup, cooling and maitenence. 

* The hypervisor is the software that sits on top of the physical hardware (or on top of an operating system) and decouples the virtual machines from the host and allocates computing resources to the VM. They take the physical resources and divide them up so that the virtual enviornments can use them.

# Career Exploration

## Career Exploration

#### Tri-C College Central:
* See attached screenshot "CollegeCentral.png"

#### Bureau of Labor Statistics
* The career I am interested in pursuing is in software development or cybersecurity. I went onto the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found both job titles: information security analysts and software developers. The average salary for an information security analyst is $99,730 per year and $105,590 for a software developer. The projected growth for information security analysts is 32% and 21% for software developers.

## Industry Certification
* The certification I chose to explore is the CompTIA CySA+ which is a cyber security analyst certification. This certification helps boost a resume and shows employers that you are able to do what you say you can. The topics covered within the certification include threat and vulnerability management, software and systems security, security operations and monitoring, and incident response. It is a multiple choice/performance based exam that is scored from 100-900. 750 is considered a passing score. The recommended having at least a couple of years of experience in the IT field before taking this exam.

## College Certificates
* After looking through the Tri-C IT Programs, I chose to focus on the Programming and Development Associate Degree Program. This is a two year associates degree that requires a total of 60-63 credit hours. The primary focus of this program is to learn ways to design, code, test, and develop software. C#, HTML, CSS, Java, and JavaScript are all languages that are covered. Networking fundamentals are also introduced as well as data structures, algorithms, and database systems. These classes are hands on and allow you to practice and refine the skills you learn by having labs, programming tasks, and group projects incorporated within.

* Explain what you need to do to become co-op "ready" and the benefits of pursuing a co-op or internship

## Professional Membership
* Pick one of the IT organizations like IEEE or ACM or a student club and report the purpose of the organization and why membership would be beneficial.
