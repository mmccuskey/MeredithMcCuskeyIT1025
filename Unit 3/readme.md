# Executive Summary
Unit 3 is a broad overview of software, introduces coding in Python, and explores career options and opportunities. Chapter 3 covers the different types of software and talks about the differences between virtualization and cloud computing. It requires use of an online IDE to run Python programs. This unit also dives into Tri-C career and co-op/internship opportunities. Certificates and certification in the field is researched and reported on.

# Software
* Software is a broad category that includes many different types of systems. Application software, commonly referred to as apps, are programs designed for end-users. The Microsoft Office package that comes with a Word, PowerPoint, and Excel would be considered application software. Web browsers including Safari and Chrome are also considered application software. Utility software is used to support the computer infrastructure. Unlike application software which is aimed at directly permorming tasks to benefit the user, utility software helps fix and modify your computer. An example of a utility software would be an anti-malware software. Operating systems manage memory and processes as well as its application/utility software and hardware. Modern operating systems use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows you to see a combination of graphics and text on the screen. Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux are the most commonly used operating systems.

* Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software is used to bring an entire organization together with one program. Utilizing a central database, ERP software allows companies to integrate all facets of their operation and provides accessibility to a large number of employees. SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft all offer an ERP system.

* Virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual machine (VM) that simulates a computer with an operating system. A single computer can perform the functions of multiple virtual computers. VMs reduce the need for power, space, and cooling in a datacenter. Cloud computing is different than virtualization. Cloud computing is when applications, services and data storage are accessible from the Internet. Cloud computing shares computing resources and is You don't have to install or upgrade any software with cloud computing like you do for virtualization. Virtualization is a technology vs cloud is an enviornment. Virtualization can be used to create clouds.

# Virtualization
* Virtualization helps companies cut down on IT costs while boosting efficiency and agility. It simplifies data management and allows for easier disaster recovery. IT organizations are able to run multiple applications and operating systems on just 1 server. This reduces the costs associated with setup, cooling and maitenence. 

* The hypervisor is the software that sits on top of the physical hardware (or on top of an operating system) and decouples the virtual machines from the host and allocates computing resources to the VM. They take the physical resources and divide them up so that the virtual enviornments can use them.

# Career Exploration

## Career Exploration

#### Tri-C College Central:
* See attached screenshot "CollegeCentral.png"

#### Bureau of Labor Statistics
* The career I am interested in pursuing is in software development or cybersecurity. I went onto the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found both job titles: information security analysts and software developers. The average salary for an information security analyst is $99,730 per year and $105,590 for a software developer. The projected growth for information security analysts is 32% and 21% for software developers.

## Industry Certification
* The certification I chose to explore is the CompTIA CySA+ which is a cyber security analyst certification. This certification helps boost a resume and shows employers that you are able to do what you say you can. The topics covered within the certification include threat and vulnerability management, software and systems security, security operations and monitoring, and incident response. It is a multiple choice/performance based exam that is scored from 100-900. 750 is considered a passing score. The recommended having at least a couple of years of experience in the IT field before taking this exam.

## College Certificates
* After looking through the Tri-C IT Programs, I chose to focus on the Programming and Development Associate Degree Program. This is a two year associates degree that requires a total of 60-63 credit hours. The primary focus of this program is to learn ways to design, code, test, and develop software. C#, HTML, CSS, Java, and JavaScript are all languages that are covered. Networking fundamentals are also introduced as well as data structures, algorithms, and database systems. These classes are hands on and allow you to practice and refine the skills you learn by having labs, programming tasks, and group projects incorporated within.

* A co-op or internship is an opportunity to gain real world skills by working with a company that specializes in your major. For example, a computer science major might get an internship or co-op with a tech company like Google or Facebook. An internship is typically unpaid while a co-op is paid. In order to become co-op "ready" I would need to submit my application, have a minimum GPA of 2.75, and have successfully completed two courses and three workshops that are related to computer science. After getting approved, I'd have to sign up for the co-op and pay the tuition in order to get credit hours for it. The benefit of pursuing a co-op is getting experience working in the field that interests you and seeing if it is a good fit. Another benefit is being able to meet and network with other people who are in the feild which could help you when you graduate and are looking for employment.

## Professional Membership
* The IT organization I chose to focus on was ACM. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a community of engineers, developers, and coders. Membership is beneficial because members have access to exclusive content, prestigious awards, events, and a learning center. Joing the ACM would open opportunities to connect with others in the field of computing.

# Conclusion
Unit 3 introduced me to Python and some of the basic commands you can do with it. I am now able to differentiate between different types of software and explain what their purpose is. I also was able to get a better of understanding cloud computing and virtualization. I have heard of those concepts before but didn't really get what people were talking about. I'm glad I was able to solidify my understanding. I also look forward to participating in a co-op experience during my time at Tri-C.
