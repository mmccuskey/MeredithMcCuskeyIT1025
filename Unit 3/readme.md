# Executive Summary
Write up as though you are explaining this week's lab to others.

# Software
* Software is a broad category that includes many different types of systems. Application software, commonly referred to as apps, are programs designed for end-users. The Microsoft Office package that comes with a Word, PowerPoint, and Excel would be considered application software. Web browsers including Safari and Chrome are also considered application software. Utility software is used to support the computer infrastructure. Unlike application software which is aimed at directly permorming tasks to benefit the user, utility software helps fix and modify your computer. An example of a utility software would be an anti-malware software. Operating systems manage memory and processes as well as its application/utility software and hardware. Modern operating systems use a Graphical User Interface (GUI)that allows you to see a combination of graphics and text on the screen. Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux are the most commonly used operating systems.

* Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software is used to bring an entire organization together with one program. Utilizing a central database, ERP software allows companies to integrate all facets of their operation and provides accessibility to a large number of employees. SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft all offer an ERP system.

* Virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual machine (VM) that simulates a computer with an operating system. A single computer can perform the functions of multiple virtual computers. Cloud computing is different than virtualization. Cloud computing is when applications, services and data storage are accessible from the Internet. You don't have to install or upgrade any software with cloud computing like you do for virtualization.
