# Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab 7 was to introduce object oriented programming, data, SQL, intellectual property laws, and internet confidentiality. How to create a class and its features and actions is covered as well as the four "V"s of big data. A brief overview of SQL and how to use some basic commands is gone over. Ethics for computing and trademarks/copyrights are covered and we are introduced to some legislation acts that deal with internet data confidntiality and access.

# Object Oriented Programming
* See unit7phone.HEIC, unit7house.HEIC, and unit7employee.HEIC

# Data, Information and Knowledge
## Relational Data
* Data is the raw bits and pieces of information with no context. Data can be quantitative or qualitative. Information is context for the data. Knowledge is when the data is put into context and use the information to make decisions.

* If you were creating a database for a small company and two tables you identify are customers and orders explain the following: (be sure to use the example in the chapter as a guide - customers and orders would be like clubs and events) 

a) The primary key would be the order number or ID that is connected to the customer.

b) Customers would be related to orders because the customer is the one placing the order.

c) The foreign key in the orders table would be the customer ID that connects to the order they placed.

d) It is important to properly define the data type of a field because a data type tells the database what functions to perform with the data. It is also important to define the data type so the proper amount of storage can be allocated for the data.

## Big Data
* The four "V"s of big data are volume, variety, velocity and veracity. Volume refers to the scale of data. Variety refers to different forms of data. Velocity is the analysis of streaming data. Veracity is the uncertainty of data.

* Some types of technology that have driven the increased need for big data are predictive analytics, NoSQL databases, data virtualization, and distributed storage.

# Structured Query Language (SQL)
* Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) is the basis for SQL. The data stored in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. 

* The two related tables I picked from the diagram is Employees and Orders. The primary key is EmployeeID and the foreign key is OrderID.

* See SelectSQL.png and WhereSQL.png

* SQL injections are a security threat because hackers can input harmful code via the web page. This could result in personal information being compromised. To reduce this issue and protect a web site from SQL injections, you can use SQL parameters.

# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
## Code of Ethics
* The purpose of a code of ethics is to outline acceptable behaviors for a professional and social group. It generally defines actions that are appropriate and inappropriate. The ACM created a code of ethics for the computing discipline to bring together a group of people committed to ethical professional conduct in relation to computing.

* The difference between a code of ethics and AUPs are that a code of ethics focuses on morals and behaviors people abide by. An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is an agreement that must be accepted before granting access to services.

The site I chose was Facebook and the policy of interest is their Workplace Acceptable Use Policy. In their AUP, you must use your real name and not misrepresent yourself in any way. You cannot be using their platform to exploit or harm children. You cannot create any content that glorfies violence, drug abuse, and/or eating disorders. You also must be older than 13 to use the service. They have the right to remove your content if they believe it violates any part of their AUP.

## Intellectual Property
* The purpose of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is to lead development of a balanced and effective international intellectual property system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all.

* A copyright is obtained simply by creating original work. The benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office is you can legally take action against someone who has used your work without your permission. It is advisable to register with the US Copyright Office if you plan on using the image or work commercially. It might be important to copyright the svg image I created because then I am making sure that image is mine legally and only I can use it.

* The role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property of an image I created is that it identifies a source of goods and services. The tradesmark shows that the image or logo has been either marked with a common-law tradesmark or registered tradesmark. This tradesmark protects the image and brand.

## Information Collection
* COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA are a collection of acts that passed in regard to restriction of collection of information on the internet. These legislative acts protect information by complying with laws about data obtained from minors, accesss to school records for parents, and healthcare confidentiality. They have specific parameters explaining what data websites and companies can and cannot collect based on the type of information.

# Conclusion
Lab 7 was informational as well as interesting. I have had a bit of an introduction to object oriented programming because I am learning C# in my other class so it was good to go over that concept. I was unaware of the details associated with dig data and completely unfamiliar with SQL. I found it interesting reading about the policies behind the ethics and confidentiality of the internet. I also found it interesting to learn about how trademarks and copyrights work.
