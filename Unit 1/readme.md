# Executive summary
The purpose of Unit 1 Lab 1 is to cover introductory material to IT 1025. It introduces what Github is and why it is used, dives into the first chapter of the textbook, and allows you to experiment with some of the features associated with Github. The first chapter covers the history to computing as well as identifying the main components of information systems.

# Information System Componentsâ€¯
In the example of the ATM, the main information systems components to it are:
* Hardware - keypad, diplay screen, card reader, screen buttons
* Software - operating system, APIs
* Data - credit card numbers, zip codes
* People - people that use the ATM
* Process - cash transaction, depositing checks, checking balances on accounts

# Github
* Github uses a "client-server" architecture. "Client-Server" refers to a networking architecture that allows users to connect to a central computer "server" using their PC "client". Github fits this model because users come from across the globe and use their computers "clients" to connect to the server Github uses.

* Github is considered "cloud-computing" because they allow their users to access shared networks of storage, servers and applications. Some other "cloud-computing" enviornments I use include Gmail and Facebook.

# Conclusion
During Unit 1 Lab 1 I learned how to navigate Github, the expectations and requirements for IT 1025, and the history of computing. I had some difficulty figuring out how to add and delete folders at first, but easily found the answer after a Google search. I look forward to continuing to learn more about Github and ways I can use it to be successful.
